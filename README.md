A **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** for searching, downloading, and reading arXiv papers — designed as a specialist agent for integration into multi-agent systems like [Microsoft Magentic-UI](https://github.com/microsoft/magentic-ui) and [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen).

> **The idea:** Rather than treating arXiv search as a simple lookup tool, this server is structured as a first-class research agent — one you can plug directly into a Magentic-One-style team as an `McpAgent`, giving an Orchestrator access to the full scientific literature as a delegatable resource.

---

## Integration with Magentic-UI

Magentic-UI supports custom `McpAgent` instances via `mcp_agent_configs` in its config file. This server plugs in directly:

```yaml
# examples/magentic_ui_config.yaml
client:
  mcp_agent_configs:
    - agent_name: ArxivResearcher
      description: >
        Specialist agent for searching and reading arXiv papers.
        Use when the task requires finding academic papers, understanding
        research literature, or retrieving technical details from published work.
      server_params:
        type: StdioServerParams
        command: python
        args: ["-m", "arxiv_mcp_server"]
        env:
          PYTHONPATH: /path/to/arxiv-deep-research/src
```

Once registered, the Magentic-UI Orchestrator can delegate research subtasks to this agent through the standard Task Ledger / Progress Ledger pattern — exactly how WebSurfer handles web browsing, but for academic literature.

---

## Integration with AutoGen AgentChat

See [`examples/autogen_research_team.py`](examples/autogen_research_team.py) for a complete 3-agent team:

```
Orchestrator (MagenticOneGroupChat)
├── ArxivSurfer  ← this MCP server, wrapped via StdioServerParams + mcp_server_tools
└── Coder        ← synthesizes findings into structured markdown reports
```

```bash
pip install "autogen-agentchat" "autogen-ext[openai]" "mcp>=1.2.0"
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
python examples/autogen_research_team.py
```

---

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_papers` | Query arXiv with advanced filters: date range, category, sort by relevance or date |
| `download_paper` | Fetch a paper PDF and convert to clean markdown for LLM consumption |
| `read_paper` | Access previously downloaded paper content |
| `list_papers` | View all papers in local storage |

### search_papers

Supports rich query syntax — quoted phrases, boolean operators, field-specific search (`ti:`, `au:`, `abs:`), and category filtering:

```json
{
  "query": "\"multi-agent\" AND \"orchestration\" ANDNOT survey",
  "max_results": 10,
  "date_from": "2024-01-01",
  "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.MA"],
  "sort_by": "relevance"
}
```

---

## Multi‑stage research pipeline

At a high level, `arxiv-deep-research` runs a simple but powerful multi‑stage loop:

1. **Plan the research task**  
   - A coordinator agent (for example the AutoGen `MagenticOneGroupChat` Orchestrator) takes the user goal and breaks it into sub‑tasks.
2. **Discover candidate papers**  
   - The coordinator calls the MCP `search_papers` tool to find relevant arXiv papers by topic, category, and date.
3. **Download and normalize content**  
   - For selected IDs, it calls `download_paper`, which fetches the PDF and converts it into clean markdown for LLMs to read.
4. **Deep paper analysis**  
   - The coordinator (or another agent) uses the `deep-paper-analysis` prompt to ask for a structured analysis of a given paper ID, optionally across multiple calls as you explore related work.
5. **Synthesis and reporting**  
   - A downstream agent such as `Coder` (in the AutoGen example) turns these analyses into a final research report: summaries, comparison tables, open problems, and next‑step suggestions.

You can run this pipeline manually by calling the tools and prompts from any MCP‑aware client, or automatically using the sample AutoGen team.

---

## Evaluation Benchmark

The repo includes a retrieval quality benchmark (`eval/benchmark.py`) measuring:

- **Precision@K** — fraction of top-K results that are relevant
- **Recall@K** — fraction of known relevant papers found in top-K
- **MRR** — Mean Reciprocal Rank of first relevant result

Ground-truth queries are seeded from landmark papers (AutoGen `2308.08155`, Magentic-One `2411.04468`, RAG `2005.11401`, CoT `2201.11903`) and can be extended automatically using the synthetic data pipeline below.

```bash
python eval/benchmark.py --k 10 --output results.json
```

---

## Synthetic Eval Data Generation (AgentInstruct-style)

`scripts/generate_eval_tasks.py` implements a 4-stage pipeline that generates diverse benchmark queries from arXiv abstracts — mirroring the [AgentInstruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10505) approach:

```
Stage 1: Seed collection     → fetch paper abstracts from arXiv by category
Stage 2: Content transform   → extract key concepts and problem statements
Stage 3: Instruction gen     → generate realistic research queries via GPT-4o-mini
Stage 4: Instruction refine  → create harder variants at subtopic intersections
```

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
python scripts/generate_eval_tasks.py --seed-category cs.AI --num-seeds 20 --output eval/generated_queries.json
```

Output includes easy/medium/hard difficulty tiers for stratified evaluation.

---

## Observability: OpenTelemetry Tracing

Every tool call is instrumented with OpenTelemetry spans (mirrors [AutoGen v0.4's built-in OTel support](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/core-user-guide/framework/telemetry.html)):

```bash
# Console output (no infrastructure needed)
export ARXIV_MCP_TRACE_CONSOLE=true
python -m arxiv_mcp_server

# OTLP export to Jaeger / Azure Monitor
docker run -d --name jaeger -p 16686:16686 -p 4317:4317 jaegertracing/all-in-one
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=arxiv-mcp-server
python -m arxiv_mcp_server
# View traces: http://localhost:16686
```

Spans recorded: `mcp.tool.search_papers`, `mcp.tool.download_paper`, `mcp.tool.read_paper` — each with query, categories, result count, latency, and error status as attributes.

Tracing is a zero-cost no-op when `opentelemetry-sdk` is not installed.

## Running and resuming research sessions

There are two main ways to run research sessions today.

### 1. AutoGen multi‑agent team (recommended demo)

This uses OpenAI models to coordinate a full research workflow.

```bash
cd arxiv-deep-research
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
pip install "autogen-agentchat" "autogen-ext[openai]" "mcp>=1.2.0"

export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
python examples/autogen_research_team.py
```

This starts an interactive console UI where:
- the **Orchestrator** plans the work,
- **ArxivSurfer** searches and downloads papers via MCP, and
- **Coder** writes the final markdown report.

To **resume a session**, you can:
- run the script again and paste the previous summary as part of a new task, or
- keep the same console session open and give the team a follow‑up instruction (for example, “Now focus on safety trade‑offs”).

### 2. Direct MCP usage from tools like Claude Desktop or Cursor

You can also talk to the MCP server directly and build your own loop:

```bash
cd arxiv-deep-research
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

export ARXIV_MCP_TRACE_CONSOLE=true   # optional
python -m arxiv_mcp_server
```

While this server runs, any MCP‑aware client can:
- call `search_papers` and `download_paper`,
- use `read_paper` to pull content into the chat, and
- call the `deep-paper-analysis` prompt multiple times.  

The prompt handler keeps a simple global **research context**, so repeated calls in the same process will mention previously analyzed paper IDs and encourage the model to connect them. In practice, “resuming” a research session means:
- keeping the same MCP server process alive, and
- issuing new `deep-paper-analysis` calls for new paper IDs from the same client or workspace.

## Known issues

- **Model support is OpenAI‑only today.**  
  - The AutoGen research team and the synthetic eval generator both call OpenAI models (`gpt-4o` / `gpt-4o-mini`) via the OpenAI Python SDK.  
  - There is **no first‑class `google-genai` / Gemini or Gemma integration yet**, even though the design would support it.
- **No MCP Resources yet.**  
  - Papers are exposed only via tools (`read_paper`) rather than as MCP Resources with stable `arxiv://` URIs. MCP clients that prefer Resources cannot list papers yet.
- **Limited testing.**  
  - The core retrieval and eval logic has very light automated testing; metric functions and tool handlers should gain unit tests over time.

---

## Roadmap

Planned improvements (subject to change):

- **Gemini / Gemma support via `google-genai`**  
  - Add an optional `google-genai` dependency and a small runner that can call Gemini/Gemma models using `GEMINI_API_KEY`.  
  - Expose this as an alternative backend for the research team demo and the eval generator.
- **MCP Resources for downloaded papers**  
  - Implement `list_resources` / `read_resource` so downloaded PDFs appear as `arxiv://paper_id` resources in MCP clients.
- **Stronger testing and evals**  
  - Add unit tests for metrics, search helpers, and prompt handlers.  
  - Automate running `eval/benchmark.py` and track regression over time.
- **Richer research sessions**  
  - Replace the simple global research context with explicit session IDs and persisted state, so “resume session X” becomes a first‑class feature across restarts.
